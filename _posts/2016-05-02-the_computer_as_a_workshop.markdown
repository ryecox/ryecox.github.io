> "True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new.” --Antoine de St. Exupery

One day I will die, and I know that I must influence people and create new things to be remembered. Heavy, true, and uncomfortable to think about.

Anyone with the compulsion to learn finds joy in the stimulation of discovery. Uncovering a new way to do something or a new set of facts is fascinating. Using those new methods and tools to make something completely new— something that has never been made before— is real happiness.

Through my career, all internal and external forces in my life drove me to become a technologist of sorts. I have built a career in business managing and selecting technologies to do jobs as a teacher, a technology manager, a consultant, and now an entrepreneur. Figuring out the best stack or configuration to complete a series of complex tasks is interesting. Being paid to learn about emerging technologies, and when I was lucky, being able to apply those same technologies to solve problems is a good gig. It is rewarding to see something you have put together solve a big problem that makes people happier, but designing systems around technologies that already exist is different than building those technologies anew in a better way.

The desire to create goes beyond the bounds of business, of course, and it goes outside of the computer. As we transition into a more connected world where living beings, devices, and software become more intertwined, those who can effectively become digital composers will have a significant advantage in life over those who do not. Code will help create the reality we have set in motion. There is no going back. 

Not being able to understand how our new world works *under the hood* is uncomfortable for someone with an inclination to explore new knowledge. Knowing *about* technology is just not enough for me. Being limited by the ideas and technologies of other people, and being unable to create the tools, apps, and relationships between all of these that I can dream up, is not something I can accept.

No matter how many mistakes I have made, or how many times I have failed, I still have a compulsion to come back to coding. The desire to create doesn’t go away, and in our increasingly digital world, I think it's a great survival tool. If I make it to old age, I don’t want to look back on my good ideas that I failed to execute because I didn’t know how. 

So here I am. I’m abstracting the world as I see it down from atoms into bits so that I can learn how to use those bits to put the atoms back together into a configuration that might just improve the world in some small way. And I will have something to show for it, which will give me the satisfaction I need to achieve the happiness of creation.

To experience joy. That's why I am learning to code.
